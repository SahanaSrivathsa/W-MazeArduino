# W-MazeArduino

The W-Track Alternation Task (Frank, Brown, Wilson 2000) has been used to examine the relationship 
between the spatially related activity of cells in the hippocampus and an animalâ€™s ability to learn to 
successfully navigate to a goal. In this task, animals must learn to navigate a w-shaped maze in an alternating pattern 
to receive reward.

This sketch controls 3 solenoids at the end of each arm of the w-shaped track. 
The solenoid is opened based on the input from 6 infrared sensors; if the animal triggers the sensors in the 
correct w-shaped pattern, the solenoid will open and dispense a food reward.

Dependencies:

Arduino Microcontroller (UNO preferred)

Arduino Software  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

6 infrared sensors on pins 6,4,2,8,9,and 10

3 twelve-volt solenoids on pins 7,5,and 3 [You will need a relay as the Arduino board uses 5 volt logic]
